      <description>Hook: An evil wizard has been terrorising the town with swarms of killer bees for long enough. The townspeople have pooled their money to pay someone to deal with the problem.
Approach: The tower the wizard lives in may once have been stone. It is now a horrific mass of twisted flesh and stone and black honeycomb. Swarms of bees hang lazily in the air and fly out to do his bidding.</description>

      <description>My first thought regarding the anomalous sector crawl was that I wanted to do something modern on The Black Hack&amp;rsquo;s framework. I put together the following classes, they follow the cleric/rogue/warrior archetypes while being setting-appropriate. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping you running a mage in the same setting and calling him a psychic mutant. Go nuts!
Doctor Starting HP: 1d6 + 4
Starting HD: 1d8
Usable Weapons/Armour: Semi automatic weapons/Shotguns/Kevlar Vest</description>

      <description>I get really stoked on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games on and off as time goes on. I love the universe and the setting, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting game environment.
It got me thinking about how the setting would go in a tabletop game. I did some reading and it looks like there isn&amp;rsquo;t much in the way of existing S.T.A.L.K.E.R material out there. I ran across a ruleset that originated on 4chan&amp;rsquo;s /tg/ but I found their take to try to be too close to the PC game.</description>

      <description>S.T.A.L.K.E.R is all about anomalies! Invisible/barely visible areas in the environment which exhibit well.. Anomalous behaviour. Below are some examples.
The idea behind most of these anomalies is that they are very dangerous, but with experience are easy to spot.
Vortex Triggered by: Any movement not caused by the vortex within radius
Effect: Pulls everything in radius to the center and deals 2d10 crushing damage per round until the victim is dead or escapes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen The Bogeyman&amp;rsquo;s Cave&amp;rsquo;s 30 minute dungeon challenge floating around on /r/osr for the last few days so I decided to try my hand at it.
It turns out writing an entire dungeon in 30 minutes is hard! Mine blew out to about 45 minutes but I don&amp;rsquo;t hate it so here it is!
Hook: An evil wizard has been terrorising the town with swarms of killer bees for long enough.</description>

      <description>My first thought regarding the anomalous sector crawl was that I wanted to do something modern on The Black Hack&amp;rsquo;s framework. I put together the following classes, they follow the cleric/rogue/warrior archetypes while being setting-appropriate. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping you running a mage in the same setting and calling him a psychic mutant. Go nuts!
Doctor Starting HP: 1d6 + 4
Starting HD: 1d8
Usable Weapons/Armour: Semi automatic weapons/Shotguns/Kevlar Vest</description>

      <description>I get really stoked on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games on and off as time goes on. I love the universe and the setting, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting game environment.
It got me thinking about how the setting would go in a tabletop game. I did some reading and it looks like there isn&amp;rsquo;t much in the way of existing S.T.A.L.K.E.R material out there. I ran across a ruleset that originated on 4chan&amp;rsquo;s /tg/ but I found their take to try to be too close to the PC game.</description>
